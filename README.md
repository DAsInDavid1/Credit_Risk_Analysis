Using Machine Learning, imbalanced -learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Will be using RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms to oversample our data and evaluate the performace of these models to make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
